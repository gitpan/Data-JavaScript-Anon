Revision history for Perl extension Data::JavaScript::Anon

0.3  Wed Aug  4 2004
	- Converted word regex to something that actually detects words
	- Fixed some minor error string bug to use Data::JavaScript::Anon
	  instead of Serlialize::JavaScript (the original name)

0.2  Thu Nov 20 2003
	- Added a highly robust and more accurate regex test for numbers.
	- Added the is_a_number method.
	- Fixed the bug from #CPAN 4056
	- Did a clean up and shrink of the code. Possibly saved enough bytes
	  to cover the addition of the regex code.
